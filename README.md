# ChooseYourStory Chrome Extension

## How To:

**This extension is made for the Google Chrome web-browser**

1) Go to https://github.com/Praxibetel/CYSCE
	- You're likely already here, reading this!
2) Click the green **[Clone or Download]** button
	- (might need to scroll up a little from this tutorial)
	- a dropdown menu will appear
3) Click **[Download ZIP]**
	- If you use Windows, you do not need 7zip to properly extract what is inside the zipped folder
		- Most modern computers have the ability to unzip without the use of third party programs
	- Save the file wherever you want (we suggest somewhere easy to navigate to)
4) Open your file explorer (on windows: click the yellow manilla folder icon)
	- On some systems, the file explorer may automatically open to show you the file you downloaded
	- If you saved the folder to your desktop, you can skip this step
5) Navigate to and **right click on the zipped folder**
	- Choose **"Extract Here"**
		- You may be able to double-click the zipped file and view the contents; dragging them out of the zipped file into another folder may automatically extract the contents of the zipped folder.
	- If you'd like to extract somewhere else, click "Extract" and specify where you want the extension to be saved.
	- A folder named CYSCE-master should appear where you extracted the folder
		- If this is not the case, you will likely have a folder titled "Extension" along with the README.md, Code of Conduct, and License information text files.
6) Go back into Chrome and visit **chrome://extensions/**
	- This is the extensions settings for Chrome
		- As such you may go into the Google Chrome settings and navigate to extension settings from there. 
7) **Enable Developer Mode** (usually a button towards the top right of the page)
	- If you share a computer with a tech-savvy person, this may already be enabled
	- A few new options and details about your current extensions should appear on the page (Load Unpacked, Pack Extension, Update)
8) Click **[Load Unpacked]** on the chrome://extensions/ page
	- A small window, similar to file explorer, titled "Browse For Folder" will appear
9) Navigate *into* CYSCE-master and **select the folder named `Extension`**
	- As long as you can navigate to and select the extension folder outside of the zipped file then you're fine.
10) Click the **[OK]** button on the window titled "Browse For Folder"
	- It should close the browse for file window and automatically enable the CYS Chrome Extension. You can check this and toggle the CYS extension directly on the chrome://extensions/ webpage, where it should be listed among any other extensions you may have.
11) **You're Done!**
	- Visit http://chooseyourstory.com/ and enjoy the extension features!
